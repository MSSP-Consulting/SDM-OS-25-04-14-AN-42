## Project Summary: 
Our analysis revealed that despite the significant disruption caused by Hurricane Helene and the r
esulting nationwide IV fluid shortage, most post-operative outcomes across orthognathic surgical 
procedures remained stable, with no significant differences observed in estimated blood loss, pos
t-operative IV fluid use, or length of hospital stay for most procedures.
